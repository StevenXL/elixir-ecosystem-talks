# Elixir Ecosystem Talks

While the Elixir ecosystem is powered by a great community, this repository is a
list of talks that I found particularly effective at teaching their respective
topics. They are very approachable, even for beginners, and provide a strong
basis for delving further into each topic.

I encourage those of you that stumble upon this repo to take a look at not only
the five talks listed, but also the conference homepage in order to learn about
other topics.
